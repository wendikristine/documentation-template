# Working with Python

The tutorial assumes you have already worked through the [Execute a Job Tutorial](./). Therefore, the instructions here are abbreviated but will follow the same format so you may easily consult the extended tutorial.

📝 **Note:** Do not execute jobs on the login nodes; only use the login nodes to access your compute nodes. Processor-intensive, memory-intensive, or otherwise disruptive processes running on login nodes will be killed without warning.

## Step 1: Access Your Allocation

If you need to request an allocation, see [instructions here](../request-access.md).

1. Open a Bash terminal \(or PuTTY for Windows users\).
2. Execute `ssh username@or-condo-login.univ.edu`.
   * Replace "username" with your  or  ID.
3. When prompted, enter your  or  password.

## Step 2: Create a PBS Script

### Example PBS Script

Here is an example PBS script for running a batch job on a HPC Condo allocation.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#PBS -N mpi_hello_world_py
#PBS -M your_email@univ.edu
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=16
#PBS -l walltime=0:00:6:0
#PBS -W group_list=cad-right
#PBS -A right
#PBS -l qos=burst
#PBS -V

module purge
module load python/3.6.1
module list
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
pwd
mpirun python hello_world.py
```

### PBS Procedure

1. From the login node, change your working directory to the desired file system. We are going to use our Lustre allocation for this example. _If Lustre storage is not available, you may complete this tutorial from within your home directory on NFS._

   ```bash
   cd /lustre/or-myst/cad-right/username
   ```

   Replace "username" with your / user ID.

2. Use Vi to create and edit your PBS script.

   ```bash
   vi hello_world_py.pbs
   ```

3. Create your PBS script within Vi or paste the contents of your PBS script into Vi.
4. Save your file and return to the Bash shell.

## Step 3: Create a Python Program

### MPI Hello World Code

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
from mpi4py import MPI

size = MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_size()
rank = MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank()
name = MPI.Get_processor_name()

print("Hello, World! I am process ",rank," of ",size," on ",name)
```

### Python Procedure

1. Ensure that you are still in your working directory \(`/lustre/or-myst/cad-right/username`\) using `pwd`.
2. Use Vi \(`vi`\) to create your C++ source file within your working directory.

   ```bash
   vi hello_world.py
   ```

3. Paste the hello world C++ code into Vi.
4. Save your file and return to the Bash shell.

_Python does not need to be compiled._

## Step 4: Run the Job

1. Before proceeding, ensure that you are still in your working directory \(using `pwd`\) and that you still have the python/3.6.1 module loaded \(using `module list`\).
   * We need to be in the same path/directory as our PBS script and our Python script. Use `ls -al` to confirm their presence.
2. Use `qsub` to schedule your batch job in the queue.

   ```bash
   qsub hello_world_py.pbs
   ```

   This command will automatically queue your job using Torque and produce a six-digit job number \(shown below\).  


   ```bash
   143295.or-condo-pbs01
   ```

   You can check the status of your job at any time with the `checkjob` command.

   ```bash
   checkjob 143295
   ```

   You can also stop your job at any time with the `qdel` command.

   ```bash
   qdel 143295
   ```

3. View your results.  
    You can view the contents of these files using the `more` command followed by the file name.  


   ```bash
   more mpi_hello_world_py.o143295
   ```

   Your output should look something like this \(_the output is truncated._\):

   ```bash
   Hello, World! I am process  11  of  20  on  or-condo-c190.univ.edu
   Hello, World! I am process  13  of  20  on  or-condo-c190.univ.edu
   Hello, World! I am process  12  of  20  on  or-condo-c190.univ.edu
   Hello, World! I am process  0   of  20  on  or-condo-c190.univ.edu
   Hello, World! I am process  15  of  20  on  or-condo-c190.univ.edu
   Hello, World! I am process  19  of  20  on  or-condo-c190.univ.edu
   Hello, World! I am process  7   of  20  on  or-condo-c190.univ.edu
   Hello, World! I am process  16  of  20  on  or-condo-c190.univ.edu
   Hello, World! I am process  3   of  20  on  or-condo-c190.univ.edu
   Hello, World! I am process  9   of  20  on  or-condo-c190.univ.edu
   .
   .
   .
   ```

4. Download your results \(using the `scp` command or an SFTP client\) or move them to persistent storage. See our [moving data](https://github.com/wendikristine/documentation-template/tree/62a326e16ecef2ff128ef0b976de12c16f6ea062/data-transfer-storage/moving-data.md) section for help.
